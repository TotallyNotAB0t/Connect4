# R-isson

Learning MCTS and agents in video games in the ESGI Master in Virtual reality and Video Game curriculum

## Concept
A blend of calssical duel sword wielding game `Nidhogg` and punitive duel fighters such as `Dropkick` or `samurai shodown`, `R-isson` lets you play as Risson or Evil Risson in a fast paced duel where you will have to stab your ennemy before he stabs you! Your defence options are limited so take care with your sword placement!
